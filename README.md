✅ Objective:
Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering on customer data and evaluate clustering quality.

📊 Dataset:
Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Dataset

🛠 Tools & Libraries:
Python

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

🚀 Steps Performed:
Loaded and Visualized dataset

Selected features: Annual Income (k$) & Spending Score (1-100)

Scaled data and optionally applied PCA

Used Elbow Method to find optimal clusters (K)

Applied K-Means clustering

Visualized color-coded clusters

Evaluated using Silhouette Score

📈 Results:
Optimal K found = 5 (from Elbow method)

Silhouette Score ≈ 0.55 (Good clustering quality)

Visualized 5 distinct customer segments
